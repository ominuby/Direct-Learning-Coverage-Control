# Direct-Learning-Coverage-Control
My master thesis is about coverage control, which finds an optimized distribution of mobile robots according to sensing importance, so-called density function. Files in this repository is about the simulation of the paper submitted in Control Technology and Applications (CCTA), 2017 IEEE Conference. 
Direct learning coverage control based on expectation maximization in wireless sensor and robot network
